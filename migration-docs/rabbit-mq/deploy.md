Deploying RabbitMQ on an AWS EC2 instance using Ansible involves several steps: preparing your Ansible environment, creating an Ansible playbook to automate the installation and configuration of RabbitMQ on the EC2 instance, and running the playbook to execute the deployment. Below is a guide to help you through this process.

### Prerequisites

- **AWS Account**: Ensure you have access to an AWS account.
- **EC2 Instance**: Have an EC2 instance running where you plan to install RabbitMQ. Ensure the security group attached allows SSH access.
- **Ansible Installed**: Ensure Ansible is installed on your local machine or wherever you plan to run the playbook from.
- **SSH Access**: You need SSH access to the EC2 instance, typically via a key pair.

### Step 1: Prepare Your Ansible Inventory

Create an Ansible inventory file (e.g., `hosts.ini`) to specify the EC2 instance(s) on which RabbitMQ will be installed. Replace `your_ec2_public_ip` with the public IP address of your EC2 instance.

```ini
[rabbitmq_servers]
rabbitmq1 ansible_host=your_ec2_public_ip ansible_user=ec2-user ansible_ssh_private_key_file=path/to/your/private/key.pem
```

### Step 2: Create an Ansible Playbook for RabbitMQ Deployment

Create a YAML file for your Ansible playbook (e.g., `deploy_rabbitmq.yml`). This playbook will install RabbitMQ on the EC2 instance specified in your inventory file.

```yaml
---
- name: Deploy RabbitMQ on EC2 Instances
  hosts: rabbitmq_servers
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Import RabbitMQ signing key
      ansible.builtin.apt_key:
        url: https://www.rabbitmq.com/rabbitmq-release-signing-key.asc
        state: present

    - name: Add RabbitMQ repository
      ansible.builtin.apt_repository:
        repo: deb https://dl.bintray.com/rabbitmq-erlang/debian bionic erlang
        state: present

    - name: Install Erlang
      ansible.builtin.apt:
        name: erlang
        state: latest
        update_cache: yes

    - name: Install RabbitMQ
      ansible.builtin.apt:
        name: rabbitmq-server
        state: latest
        update_cache: yes

    - name: Enable and start RabbitMQ service
      ansible.builtin.service:
        name: rabbitmq-server
        state: started
        enabled: yes
```

This playbook does the following:
- Imports the RabbitMQ signing key.
- Adds the RabbitMQ repository.
- Installs Erlang, which is a dependency for RabbitMQ.
- Installs RabbitMQ.
- Ensures the RabbitMQ service is enabled and started.

### Step 3: Run the Ansible Playbook

Execute the playbook against your inventory file to deploy RabbitMQ on your EC2 instance.

```bash
ansible-playbook -i hosts.ini deploy_rabbitmq.yml
```

### Additional Configuration

Depending on your requirements, you might want to configure RabbitMQ further, such as setting up users, permissions, or clustering. You can extend the playbook with additional tasks to perform these configurations.

### Note

- The provided playbook example uses `apt` for package management, assuming the target system is based on Debian or Ubuntu. If you're using a Red Hat-based system (like Amazon Linux), replace the `apt` modules with `yum`.
- Ensure your EC2 instance's security group allows the necessary ports for RabbitMQ communication.

This guide provides a basic outline for deploying RabbitMQ on an AWS EC2 instance using Ansible. Depending on your specific use case, you might need to customize the playbook further.
