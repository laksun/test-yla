To use Terraform for deploying an AWS EC2 instance with specific AMI ID and user data, and manage it with AWS Systems Manager (SSM), follow this guide. We will take the AMI ID and user data as inputs using Terraform variables. This setup assumes you have basic familiarity with Terraform.

### Step 1: Define Terraform Variables

Create a file named `variables.tf` to declare your variables for the AMI ID and user data.

```hcl
variable "ami_id" {
  description = "AMI ID for the EC2 instance"
  type        = string
}

variable "user_data" {
  description = "Path to the user data script file"
  type        = string
}
```

### Step 2: Configure AWS Provider and SSM Role

In your `main.tf`, set up the AWS provider and an IAM role for the EC2 instance to communicate with Systems Manager.

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1" # Update this to your AWS region
}

resource "aws_iam_role" "ssm_role" {
  name = "ssm_role"

  assume_role_policy = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17",
    Statement = [{
      Action = "sts:AssumeRole",
      Effect = "Allow",
      Principal = {
        Service = "ec2.amazonaws.com",
      },
    }],
  })
}

resource "aws_iam_role_policy_attachment" "ssm_policy" {
  role       = aws_iam_role.ssm_role.name
  policy_arn = "arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AmazonEC2RoleforSSM"
}
```

### Step 3: Create the EC2 Instance with User Data

Use the variables to create an EC2 instance with the provided AMI ID and user data. The instance is assigned the role created above for SSM access.

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = var.ami_id
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  user_data     = file(var.user_data)

  iam_instance_profile = aws_iam_instance_profile.ssm_profile.name

  tags = {
    Name = "ExampleInstance"
  }
}

resource "aws_iam_instance_profile" "ssm_profile" {
  name = "ssm_profile"
  role = aws_iam_role.ssm_role.name
}
```

### Step 4: Provide Variable Inputs

Create a `terraform.tfvars` file or input variables directly via command line or a CI/CD pipeline.

**terraform.tfvars:**
```hcl
ami_id    = "ami-1234567890abcdef0"
user_data = "path/to/your/userdata.sh"
```

### Step 5: Initialize and Apply Terraform Configuration

1. **Initialize Terraform** to download necessary plugins:
```bash
terraform init
```

2. **Apply your Terraform configuration** to create resources. Terraform will prompt you to review and approve the action:
```bash
terraform apply
```

### Notes

- **Security Group**: Consider defining a security group within `main.tf` for your EC2 instance to control access. Attach it to the instance by adding a `vpc_security_group_ids` attribute.
- **IAM Permissions**: Ensure your AWS credentials have sufficient permissions to create these resources.
- **Systems Manager (SSM)**: For the instance to fully integrate with SSM, it must be in a VPC with access to SSM endpoints, either through the internet (via an Internet Gateway or NAT Gateway) or via VPC Endpoints for private access.

This guide provides a simple Terraform setup to deploy an EC2 instance managed by AWS Systems Manager with AMI and user data as inputs. Depending on your infrastructure and security requirements, you may need to adjust and extend this configuration.
